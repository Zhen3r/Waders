### Abstract

The Great Knot (Calidris tenuirostris) is one of the iconic long-distance migratory species of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. However very little is known about the migratory strategies and the breeding grounds of this species. Luckily, researchers from *Deakin University* used geolocators deployed on Great Knots, and tracked 8 individuals for more than one year.

Another intention of this project is environment protection. According to researchers, this species will most likely be affected by the habitat loss in the area of the Yellow Sea and other parts of the Chinese coastline. Thus, it is an excellent case showing the urge and effectiveness of environment protection.

The project will focus mainly on a summer of several waders. In particular:

- Detailed migration routes and their travel time.
- Basic informations about this species.
- The rapid changing (land cover / pollution) of their habitats from ~2000 to ~2020 using raster dataset from *google earth engine*.
- The relationship between wind and migration.
- Migration data visualization including speed and time.
- (If applicable) Population size and conservation status.

### Goal

* Increase interest in birds and emphasize the need and effectiveness of environmental protection。

### Users

* The public who are interested in birds and would like to learn about this amazing species.
* Bird enthusiasts who want to know more about migratory shorebirds of the EAAF (East Asian-Australasian Flyway) and the impact of the habitat, winds, and migration details.
